# Connect Four

A Connect Four game. It is possible to compete against another human at one
computer or via a network connection. You can also play against a computer
opponent. The game rules (like the number of rows and columns or the number of
discs needed in a row to win) can be freely configured. This game has been
developed for a project in an university course.

To launch the program you will need Java in version 1.6 or higher. Under Unix
environments (Linux, Mac OS X, â€¦) you can start the program with `connectfour.sh`.
Under Windows you can use `connectfour.bat` for this.
